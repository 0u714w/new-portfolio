        Hi. I'm Doug ðŸ™‚ I've spent most of my life writing music for a living,
        now I write code.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        How I bring value:
        <br /> 1. I humanize coding <br /> 2. Iâ€™m an avid problem solver <br /> 3.
        Team work! I collaborate with those around me to drive better and faster
        results.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I have four years of experience writing and maintaining backend and full
        stack applications built in php, javascript, and python. I thrive on
        great teamwork and innovative thinking. I am a problem solver both at
        home and in the workplace, and I strive to make other's lives better
        with the gifts I've been given.
